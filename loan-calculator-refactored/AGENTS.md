# Contributor Guidelines

- JavaScript files in this project are loaded as classic scripts. Avoid ES module syntax (e.g., `export`/`import`) and keep browser globals working.
- Stick to the existing Tailwind-based styling; prefer utility classes over custom CSS when possible.
- Keep the dark theme as the default experience; ensure new components look correct in dark mode.
- When adding new assets, place them in the existing `css/` or `js/` folders to keep the structure tidy.
